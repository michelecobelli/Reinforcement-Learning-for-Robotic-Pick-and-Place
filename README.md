# ðŸ¤– Reinforcement Learning for Pick-and-Place Robotics in Obstacle-Rich Environments

## ðŸ”§ Project Context: Robotic Pick-and-Place Tasks

In pick-and-place robotics, a robotic arm must move from a **start position to a target location** (e.g., to pick or place an object) while **safely navigating around obstacles**. These obstacles may vary in size, severity, or risk â€” requiring the robot to **adapt its path** based on the workspace condition.

This project simulates the **core decision-making process** behind such motion using **reinforcement learning (RL)**. We model the environment as a 2D grid world where the agent learns to move intelligently across the grid while avoiding high-risk zones.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

We created a custom **Gymnasium environment** where:
- The **agent** starts in a random position on the top row
- The **goal** is located on the bottom center (simulating the "place" zone)
- The **grid** contains randomly placed obstacles with varying risk levels:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue = low severity (passable)
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = medium severity (avoid if possible)
  - ðŸ”´ Red = high severity (must avoid)
- The agent can move in **8 directions**, mimicking flexible robotic motion

Using **Q-learning**, the agent is trained over hundreds of episodes to:
- Reach the goal efficiently
- Avoid obstacles
- Learn movement strategies that generalize to new layouts

## ðŸ¤– Application to Robotics

This setup reflects a real robotic pick-and-place scenario where:
1. A **vision system** maps the workspace and classifies obstacles
2. The map is translated into a grid environment
3. The RL model guides the robotic armâ€™s movement to:
   - Pick up objects
   - Place them in target zones
   - Avoid dangerous or cluttered areas

This logic applies to:
- Robotic arms on fabrication lines
- Warehouse sorting robots
- Mobile manipulators navigating tight spaces

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Scope

This simulation can evolve into a real-world robotic system by:
- Connecting to live computer vision input (e.g., cameras or LiDAR)
- Mapping real obstacles into the grid
- Sending movement commands to a real robotic arm
- Using 3D representations for more accurate planning and feedback

It also has potential for:
- Autonomous rover navigation (space or terrain robotics)
- Multi-robot collaboration in shared workspaces
- Real-time dynamic obstacle handling

Letâ€™s train robots to move smarter, safer, and more adaptively â€” one episode at a time.
