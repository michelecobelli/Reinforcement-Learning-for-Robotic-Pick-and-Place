# 🤖 Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Navigation in Obstacle-Filled Environments

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project explores how a robot can learn to **navigate a 2D space** with obstacles of varying severity using **reinforcement learning (RL)**. Inspired by real-world robotic applications such as **pick-and-place tasks**, warehouse logistics, and mobile navigation (e.g., rovers), we simulate how an agent makes intelligent movement decisions in a grid-based environment.

We use a custom **Gymnasium** environment where:
- The agent must reach a goal zone from a random starting point.
- The grid contains obstacles of different risk levels:
  - 🔵 Low-risk (can pass if necessary)
  - 🟨 Medium-risk (to be avoided if possible)
  - 🔴 High-risk (must avoid completely)
- The environment randomizes each episode to promote generalization.

## 🧠 RL Strategy
The agent is trained using **Q-learning**, a classic value-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Reward shaping encourages it to:
- Move toward the goal
- Avoid dangerous areas
- Learn efficient, safe paths

Over multiple episodes, the agent develops a **policy** to navigate intelligently — even in previously unseen environments.

## 🦾 Relevance to Robotics
This simulation reflects the early stages of an **autonomous robotic system**, where a computer vision pipeline would first map the space and classify obstacles. The RL model would then:
- Interpret this mapped environment as a grid
- Learn to navigate based on obstacle types and positions
- Inform **real-time motion planning** for robotic arms or mobile platforms

This is particularly useful for:
- Pick-and-place in dynamic fabrication settings
- Indoor warehouse navigation
- Autonomous rover path planning in unstructured environments

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate real-world vision systems (e.g. depth cameras, LiDAR) to generate live obstacle maps
- Deploy the trained model on physical robots to guide real-world pick-and-place tasks
- Extend to 3D movement or continuous control spaces
- Combine with SLAM and object recognition for full autonomy

Let’s build smarter robots — one episode at a time. 🧠🦾
